A model parameterization of the two-phase exponential decay model for viral dynamics under therapy 
generated from the following publications (1,2).

The first run was done for 100000 iterations to find a suitable covariance matrix and to find convergence. 
The Warm start following was ran for 200000 total iterations and was able to properly sample the posterior distribution. 
The configuration of the warm start was preserved and can be found in the configuration file in this folder. 
The calculated covariance matrix and diffusivity was also saved and can be found in the associated output folder under the adaptive_files
subdirectory.
