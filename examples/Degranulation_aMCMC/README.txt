A parameter estimation of a published degranulation model (1).

This run was done to compare the am PyBNF method to the mh PyBNF method. 

The configuration settings for the run can be found in the configuration file in this folder.  
The calculated covariance matrix and diffusivity was saved and can be found in the associated output 
folder under the adaptive files subdirectory

The specifics of the resources used for the run can be found in the .sh file in this folder.

A full description of the model can be found in the supplementary methods.
